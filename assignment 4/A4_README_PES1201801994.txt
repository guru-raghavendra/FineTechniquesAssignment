A program usually loses it's result once it terminates, so to store the data structure and retrieve it for the next time when you are running the program.

The free head will have the offset value to the free node pointer where a new key can be inserted according to the predicate of the binary search tree. 

When a key is deleted, the free head points towards the free location after it's deletion.

Each time a deletion or an insertion occurs the file is updated accordingly.

I have used the functions and structures according given in assignment_4.h header file.
